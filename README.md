# Secure File Vault

Secure File Vault is a Python-based application designed to encrypt and decrypt files using strong cryptographic techniques. It features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for ease of use, along with user authentication using password hashing, file encryption/decryption with Fernet (AES), and logging of all user actions for security auditing. The system also includes a separate batch processing script for encrypting or decrypting all files in a folder.
